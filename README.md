# MAP practicals

<ul>
	<li>For all the practicals in different folders in this repo, after pulling this repo, are supposed to be placed outside the root directory of the repo</li>
	<li>For AMQP:
		<ol>
			<li>Folder name- rabbitmq</li>
			<li>Install rabbitmq-server from https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html</li>
			<li>In python I have implemented a basic service of note(like Google Keep). Here we can add a note and get any note by its ID. Commands:
				<ul>
					<li>python3 server.py</li>
					<li>python3 client.py</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
